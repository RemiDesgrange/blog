HiðŸ‘‹! I'm RÃ©mi, French guy working for [Ielo](https://www.ielo.net/) as Software Engineer. I'm living in the french alps. I enjoy being in mountain and learning news things !

This blog was started to remember stuff that I need to remember, like "How right management work on PG ?" or "configuring gitlab-ci to deploy my python stuff.". Also to share personal thought about subject I care about (that's a lot !!).

I have no expectation about this blog. I'll update when I have time ðŸ˜¬.
