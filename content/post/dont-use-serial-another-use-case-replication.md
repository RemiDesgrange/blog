Recently I read the excellent article of LÃ¦titia Avrot [about migrating with logical replication(fr)](https://www.loxodata.com/post/migration_logique/). For me this is another case against using serial on you db. I'm going to use docker to create two instance of postgresql and migrate it, but the fact that I'm creating it on docker is really not important here.


# Logical replication: pro

* 

# Logical replication: con


# Setup


# And ?

And that's it ! you don't have to synchronise anything, because there is nothing to synchronize !
